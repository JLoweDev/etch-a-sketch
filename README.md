# etch-a-sketch
## Pre-Project Plan
Create an app using javascript, CSS, and HTML to simulate an etch-a-sketch. Will need to google around to solve some issues.

## Post-Project Lessons
Made use of ECMAScript 6 backticks after not using them before, had a lot of fun creating this project even if it chugs a little on my machine. 

Greatly simplified my code for this project and made the site more visually appealing.
